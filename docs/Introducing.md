# Introducing

Bitscpt is the first scalable Bitcoin-native data availability layer.

## Bitscpt: Unleashing the potential of developers on the Bitcoin network

### Introduction

In the dynamic development of blockchain technology, you may have come across terms such as **Inscription, Rune** or **BTCL2**.

Although **BitScpt does not fall directly into these categories** it carries their concepts **and extends these capabilities in transformative ways**

### Development background

- In March 2023, the Bitcoin network witnessed an epoch-making evolution-the introduction of the ordinal protocol. This protocol specifies a method for seamlessly operating tokens and NFTs on the Bitcoin network.
- In May 2023, with the rise of platforms such as Unisat and MagicEden, a thriving Bitcoin ecosystem quickly formed. While these advances advance token mechanisms on Bitcoin, they lack a key component—developer programming autonomy.

- Out of curiosity and innovation, we explore the underlying principles of these protocols. This exploration led to an idea: Why not replicate these mechanisms in a way that empowers developers to craft their own solutions?
- Bitscpt was born from this vision. It's not just a protocol, it's a revolutionary tool that unlocks endless possibilities for developers. Like Ethereum’s smart scripts, Bitscpt makes it possible to develop and execute decentralized applications. However, it differentiates itself by using JavaScript, a language known among developers for its ubiquity and ease of use.
- Bitscpt is designed to make everything you imagine possible. It brings the versatility of Ethereum smart scripts to the solid, secure Bitcoin network, but with a twist – using JavaScript. This approach not only makes blockchain development more accessible, but also opens up a new horizon for innovation that was previously limited to more complex programming languages.
- Bitscpt is an important expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem. It is not just an enhancement to existing technology, but a bridge that perfectly combines the stability of Bitcoin with the innovation of modern blockchain technology. Through Bitscpt, developers can create complex smart scripts on the Bitcoin network, perform cross-chain transactions, and even develop and manage decentralized applications, while maintaining the core security and decentralization features of the Bitcoin network.


### Conclusion

  **BitScpt** is an important expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem. It is not just an enhancement to existing technology, but a bridge that perfectly combines the stability of Bitcoin with the innovation of modern blockchain technology. Through Bitscpt, developers can deploy complex smart scripts on the Bitcoin network, perform cross-chain transactions, and even develop and manage decentralized applications, while maintaining the core security and decentralization features of the Bitcoin network.

## What can it do?

Implement anything you want, just like Ethereum’s **Smart Scripts**

The difference is programming with **JavaScript**

Here is a simple script example:
```javascript
/*
Generate a simple script template.
Note: You should not have constructors
*/
class script {
	
      init(){
        
      }
	
}
```
:::caution
- The name of the entry class must be script
- Constructors should not be implemented in entry classes
- The init function must exist whether or not it is encoded in the function body
