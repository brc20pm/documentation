# Introduce
 

This is a BRC20 extension module that will bring programmability to Bitcoin. You can think of it as an execution layer in a modular blockchain.

### Development background
- In March 2023, the Bitcoin network underwent a landmark change with the release of the Ordinals protocol. Domo then proposed the BRC20 standard, which specifies a method for seamlessly running tokens and NFTs on the Bitcoin network.
- In May 2023, with the rise of Unisat, MagicEden and other platforms, a flourishing Bitcoin ecosystem was rapidly formed. While these advancements advance Bitcoinâ€™s token mechanics, they lack a key componentâ€”developer programming autonomy.
- BRC20pm was born from this vision. It is a revolutionary tool that unlocks endless possibilities for developers. Like Ethereum's Smart Script, BRC20pm makes it possible to develop and execute decentralized applications in the BRC20 standard. However, what makes it unique is that it uses JavaScript, a language well-known among developers for its ubiquity and ease of use.
- BRC20pm is designed to make anything you imagine possible. It brings the versatility of Ethereum smart scripts to the reliable, secure Bitcoin network, but with a twist â€“ using JavaScript. This approach not only makes blockchain development easier, but also opens up new horizons for innovation that were previously limited to more complex programming languages.

### Conclusion

**BRC20pm** is an important extension of the BRC20 standard. It is not only an enhancement to the existing standard, but also a bridge that perfectly combines the stability of Bitcoin with the innovation of modern blockchain technology. Through BRC20pm, developers can deploy complex smart scripts on the Bitcoin network, conduct cross-chain transactions, and even develop and manage decentralized applications while maintaining the core security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network.

## What can it do?

Implement anything you want, just like Ethereumâ€™s **Smart Contract**

The difference is programming with **JavaScript**

Here is a simple script example:
```javascript
/*
Generate a simple script template.
Note: You should not have constructors
*/
class Contract {
	
      init(){
        
      }
	
}
```
:::caution
- The name of the entry class must be Contract
- Constructors should not be implemented in entry classes
- The init function must exist whether or not it is encoded in the function body
